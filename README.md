# <div align="center">Bangalore House Price Prediction</div>


## Business Problem :

Real estate prices in Bangalore vary widely across locations and property features, making it difficult for buyers and sellers to estimate the fair market value of a home. This uncertainty often leads to mispricing, slower sales, or poor investment decisions.


## Objectives :

The goal is to build a machine learning model that predicts house prices in Bangalore using features like area size (in sqft), number of BHKs, number of bathrooms, and location. By providing accurate price estimates, the model helps buyers assess affordability and enables sellers to set competitive, data-driven listing prices.
